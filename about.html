                <p><span>Our Mission:</span>To help local, independent bookstores thrive in the age of ecommerce.</p>
                <p><span>Our Vision:</span>We work to connect readers with independent booksellers all over 
                    the world. We believe local bookstores are essential community hubs that foster culture, curiosity, and a love of reading, and we're committed to helping them survive and thrive. Our platform gives independent bookstores tools 
                    to compete online and financial support to help them maintain their presence in local communities.
                </p>
                <p><span>Our Story:</span>  Bookshop.org began as an idea to help support bookstores and their communities at a time when more and more people were buying their
                    books online. We saw an opportunity to create an alternative to Amazon for socially-conscious online shoppers. Amazon sells over 60% of all books in the US and is growing. That shift threatens the future of bookstores and will
                    hurt readers, authors, and publishers who rely on a diverse, healthy ecosystem for books.
                    <i>" We had a better idea â€” give readers the convenience of online 
                        shopping while supporting independent bookstores at the same time. "</i>
                
                </p>
                <p><span>How Bookstore Works:</span>
                <br>
                We ship your books from our wholesaler's warehouse directly to you,
                handle the customer service and overhead, and the bookstores get the profit.
